q1,Q1. Some question text related to introductory presentation content.
q2,Q2. Some question text related to introductory presentation content.
q3,Q3. Fill out information about your selected Virginia Reservoirs LTREB site.
q3a,a. Name of selected site:
q3b,b. Four letter site identifier:
q3c,c. Reservoir uses:
q3d,d. Mean total phosphorus (ug/l):
q3e,e. Reservoir area (sq ft):
q3f,f. Maximum depth (ft):
q4,Q4. Does your chosen reservoir site exceed a TSI of 60 (indicating negative human impacts on water quality) according to average total phosphorus levels? 
q5,Q5. Water is most dense at 4 degrees Celsius. What temperature is this in degrees Fahrenheit?
q6,Q6. Describe two possible effects fall turnover can have on water quality.
q7,Q7. The water temperatures on the plot are in degrees Celsius. What is the warmest observed water temperature at your reservoir in degrees Fahrenheit?
q8,Q8. What is the coldest observed water temperature at your reservoir in degrees Fahrenheit?
q9,Q9. Fall turnover can be defined as the day when the temperature difference between the shallowest and deepest depths in the reservoir is less than 1 degree Celsius. What day did fall turnover occur in the reservoir? 
q10,"Q10. During summer thermal stratification, dissolved oxygen in the bottom waters of a reservoir may become depleted. Explain why this occurs."
q11,Q11. Why are low dissolved oxygen levels often associated with poor water quality?
q12,Q12. The dissolved oxygen data on the plot are in ppm. What is lowest observed dissolved oxygen concentration in the surface waters of the reservoir in mg/L?
q13,Q13. What is the lowest observed dissolved oxygen concentration in the bottom waters of the reservoir in mg/L?
q14,"Q14. Two mg/L is a commonly used threshold to indicate that dissolved oxygen concentrations are low enough to cause water quality concerns. Does your reservoir exhibit dissolved oxygen concentrations less than 2 mg/L? If so, at which depth and when during the year does this occur?"
q15,Q15. Name two factors that can contribute to high turbidity in a raw water source.
q16,"Q16. Explain, in your own words, why it is important for treatment plant operators to know the turbidity of the raw water."
q17,"Q17. The dissolved oxygen data on the plot are in FNU. What is the highest observed turbidity in the surface waters of the reservoir in NTU, and when does it occur?"
q18,Q18. The turbidity data on the plot are from the reservoir's surface waters. Make a hypothesis about what might cause high turbidity in the surface waters at the time of year that you observe the highest turbidity in the data.
q19,Q19. Is the reservoir currently thermally stratified or mixed? Explain how you know.
q20,"Q20. Do you observe hypoxia at any depth in the reservoir? If so, which depth?"
q21,Q21. At what depth is the turbidity sensor deployed? 
q22,Q22. Which depth do you choose for water extraction?
q23,Q23. Explain your reasoning behind your decision.
q24,Q24. Fall turnover occurs when water temperatures are within 1 degree C of each other across all the depths of the reservoir. On what date did fall turnover occur this past fall?
q25,Q25. What happens to DO during fall turnover? How might this affect water quality?
q26,Q26. What happens to turbidity during fall turnover? How might this affect water quality?
q27,Q27. Which depth would you choose for water extraction TWO DAYS BEFORE the day of fall turnover? Explain your reasoning.
q28,Q28. Which depth would you choose for water extraction TWO DAYS AFTER the day of fall turnover? Explain your reasoning.
q29,"Q29. Compare your answers to Q27 and Q28. Were your choices different before and after turnover? If so, explain why."
q30,Q30. Is the reservoir currently thermally stratified or mixed? Explain how you know.
q31,"Q31. Compare dissolved oxyen concentrations at the deepest depth in your reservoir (29.5 ft for Falling Creek and 42.7 ft for Beaverdam) between the summer and winter data. Do they differ? If so, how?"
q32,"Q32. Compare turbidity concentrations in your reservoir between the summer and winter data. Do they differ? If so, how?"
q33,Q33. Which depth do you choose for water extraction?
q34,Q34. Explain your reasoning behind your decision.
q35,Q35. What is the forecasted probability of turnover occurring on Oct. 15? Do you think it is likely turnover will occur on this date?
q36,Q36. What is the forecast probability of turnover occurring on Oct. 27? Do you think it is likely turnover will occur on this date?
q37,Q37. What water quality changes (positive or negative!) might you observe when the reservoir turns over? Name at least two.
q38,Q38. Do you decide to enact additional treatment measures (yes or no)? 
q39,Q39. Explain your reasoning behind your decision.
q40,Q40. Do you decide to enact additional treatment measures (yes or no)? 
q41,Q41. Explain your reasoning behind your decision.
q42,"Q42. Compare the decisions you made in Q38 and Q40. Are they the same or different, and why?"
q43,Q43. Do you decide to enact additional treatment measures (yes or no)? 
q44,Q44. Explain your reasoning behind your decision.
q45,Q45. Do you decide to enact additional treatment measures (yes or no)? 
q46,Q46. Explain your reasoning behind your decision.
q47,"Q47. Compare the decisions you made in Q43 and Q45. Are they the same or different, and why?"
q48,"Q48. Using the data plotted in the figures above, describe how fall turnover affected reservoir water quality."
q49,"Q49. Using the data plotted in the figures above, do you think you made the right treatment decisions in Q43 and Q45? Explain your reasoning."
q50,Q50. Evaluate the usefulness of the turnover forecasts. Did having a forecast available affect your decision-making compared to using real-time data?
