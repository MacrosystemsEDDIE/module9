q10,Q10. Is the reservoir currently thermally stratified or mixed? Explain how you know.
q11,"Q11. Do you observe hypoxia at any depth in the reservoir? If so, which depth?"
q12,"Q12. At what depth is the turbidity sensor deployed, and is turbidity currently high or low (need to define what ""high"" and ""low"" mean)? "
q13,Q13. Which depth do you choose for water extraction?
q14,Q14. Explain your reasoning behind your decision.
q15,Q15. Fall turnover occurs when water temperatures are within 1 degree C of each other across all the depths of the reservoir. On what date did fall turnover occur this past fall?
q16,Q16. What happens to DO during fall turnover? How might this affect water quality?
q17,Q17. What happens to turbidity during fall turnover? How might this affect water quality?
q18,Q18. Which depth would you choose for water extraction TWO DAYS BEFORE the day of fall turnover? Explain your reasoning.
q19,Q19. Which depth would you choose for water extraction TWO DAYS AFTER the day of fall turnover? Explain your reasoning.
q20,"Q20. Compare your answers to Q18 and Q19. Were your choices different before and after turnover? If so, explain why."
q21,Q21. Is the reservoir currently thermally stratified or mixed? Explain how you know.
q22,"Q22. Compare dissolved oxyen concentrations at the deepest depth in your reservoir (9 m for Falling Creek and 13 m for Beaverdam) between the summer and winter data. Do they differ? If so, how?"
