q13,"Q13. Do you observe hypoxia (will need to introduce hypoxia first!)? If so, when and at what depths in which reservoir?"
q14,"Q14. Based on these figures, when and at what depth do you observe the greatest risk of impaired water quality? Explain your reasoning."
q15,Q15. What happens to DO during fall turnover? How might this affect water quality?
