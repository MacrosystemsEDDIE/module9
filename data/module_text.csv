water_quality,"Water quality is the suitability of water for human use, such as drinking water or irrigation, as well as the degree to which a water body can support important ecosystem processes, such as sustaining a fish population."
high_freq_data,"High-frequency water quality data are measurements of various attributes of a water body (such as temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH, etc.) that are taken many times a day (for example, every 10 minutes). High-frequency data allow water managers and scientists to observe and analyze patterns and trends in water quality that were not previously measurable using low-frequency (once a day or even less frequently) measurements."
collection,"High-frequency water quality data are often collected using automated sensors. These sensors are deployed in a water body attached to buoys, catwalks, or other structures and collect data continuously. Many of these sensors are automated, which means they can wirelessly stream data to a server so that it is accessible to managers in near-real time."

turb,"Turbidity is a measure of water clarity. Increases in turbidity may be caused by the presence of any of the following substances in water: silt and clay, microorganisms, or substances dissolved in the water, such as organic matter."
turb_measure,"Turbidity can be measured using high-frequency sensors. These sensors shine a light into the water and then measure how much of the light is scattered by particles and dissolved substances in the water. The more light is scattered, the higher the turbidity. In our data today, turbidity is measured in Formazin Nephelometric Units (FNU); ""formazin nephelometric"" just describes the type of light that is being used to measure turbidity."
turb_wq,"Excess turbidity can clog treatment plant filters, requiring more frequent cleaning or changing of filters."
wtemp,"Water temperature determines which organisms can survive in the water and how quickly they grow. In addition, differences in water temperature from the top to the bottom of the water column, known as thermal stratification, can lead to differences in water quality at different depths."
stratification,"Thermal stratification refers to differences in water temperature at different depths in a reservoir. This occurs because the density of water depends on its temperature (see figure below). Denser water sinks to the bottom of the reservoir, while less dense water is at the surface."
seasonal_strat,"In summer, warmer, less dense water stays at the surface of the reservoir, while colder, denser water sinks. This leads to 'summer stratification', where the water is warmest at the surface and coldest at the sediments. In winter, if ice forms on the reservoir, 'inverse stratification' may occur. In this case, because water is densest at 4 degrees Celsius, the water is slightly warmer at depth than at the icy surface (remember, ice forms at 0 degrees Celsius!)."
turnover,"Turnover is when thermal stratification dissipates due to seasonal changes in air temperature. In the fall, turnover occurs as air temperatures decrease, cooling the surface waters. In spring, turnover occurs as ice melts. In both cases, water temperature becomes the same from the top to the bottom of the water column. When this occurs, we refer to the reservoir as 'mixed'."
strat_wq,"During summer stratification, water quality conditions can be very different in the surface and bottom depths of a reservoir. At the surface, warm water and high sunlight may promote harmful algal blooms (see below). At depth, thermal stratification prevents oxygen from the atmosphere entering the water. This may lead to depleted oxygen in the bottom of the reservoir, which can lead to water quality concerns such as release of metals (iron, manganese) and nutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus) from the sediments. Nutrients can further stimulate harmful algal blooms."
turnover_wq,"During fall turnover, metals and nutrients that have been released into the bottom waters of the reservoir during the summer can be released to the surface, potentially leading to taste and odor concerns or stimulating harmful algal blooms."
do,Dissolved oxygen is the concentration of oxygen gas in water. It is typically measured in units of parts per million (ppm) or milligrams per liter (mg/L).
do_wtemp,"Dissolved oxygen is related to water temperature in two ways. 1) Colder water can carry more dissolved oxygen than warm water (see figure below). 2) During summer thermal stratification, dissolved oxygen may become depleted in the cold, bottom waters of the reservoir, because there is no opportunity for atmospheric oxygen to be mixed into these waters at depth."
do_wq,"Often, higher levels of dissolved oxygen are indicative of better water quality, while lower levels of dissolved oxygen are indicative of lower water quality. This is because low levels of dissolved oxygen can cause the release of metals (iron, manganese) and nutrients (phosphorus, nitrogen) from the sediments, which ultimately compromise water quality due to taste and odor concerns and potential stimulation of harmful algal blooms."

chla,Chlorophyll-a data are a useful proxy for phytoplankton biomass in lakes. Chlorophyll-a is a molecule that phytoplankton use for photosynthesis. Measuring chlorophyll-a concentrations in water can give a bulk estimate of phytoplankton concentrations. Chlorophyll-a data can be collected at a high frequency by automated sensors.
phyto_wq,"Phytoplankton are microscopic primary producers that live in the water. They are the dominant primary producers in many lakes and reservoirs. Excess phytoplankton biomass can lead to harmful algal blooms (HABs), which compromise water quality through production of toxins, production of taste and odor compounds, and creation of anoxic (low-oxygen zones), which can lead to release of metals and other undesirable compounds from reservoir sediments."
chla_wq,A reservoir may be at risk of experiencing water quality degradation due to HABs when chlorophyll-a is elevated.
